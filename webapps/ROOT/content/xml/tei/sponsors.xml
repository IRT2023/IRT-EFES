                 <p>The first sponsors of our work in <ref target="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/">EpiDoc</ref> were the <ref target="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/">Leverhulme Trust</ref>, who, in 2002, funded Charlotte Roueché and Tom Elliott to work on 
                     the development of EpiDoc for publishing the 
                     Inscriptions of Aphrodisisias in 2002 (see <ref target="http://www.epapp.kcl.ac.uk/">EPAPP</ref>). 
                     The resultant publications (see <ref target="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/index.html">InsAph</ref>) were funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board (later the <ref target="https://ahrc.ukri.org/">Arts and Humanities Research Council</ref>) 
                     </p>
                 <p>In 2007 we received a new grant from the Leverhulme Trust to start work on the online publication of the Inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica, assembled over years by Joyce Reynolds.
                     The project took a long time, but on the way to completion it enabled the production of several other resources.
                 </p>
                 <p>In 2008 Elliott and Roueché received a grant from <ref target="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</ref> in the UK and the 
                     <ref target="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</ref> in the USA for a collaborative project to explore the publication of inscriptions in 
                 association with geodata (see <ref target="https://concordia.atlantides.org/">Concordia</ref>); 
                     this enabled the publication online of the <ref target="http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/index.html">Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania (2009)</ref>.</p>
                 <p>On the basis of the geographical data collected for the Concordia project Dr Hafed Walda went on to collect the relevant geodata for Cyrenaica; 
                     he was funded by a Libyan Heritage Management Fellowship provided by Global Business Services. These data were then deployed in the 
                   <ref target="http://www.slsgazetteer.org/">Heritage Gazetteer of Libya</ref>; some of the underlying structure was drawn from work funded by the <ref target="http://www.leventisfoundation.org/en/">A.G Leventis Foundation</ref>, 
                     for the <ref target="http://www.cyprusgazetteer.org/">Heritage Gazetteer of Cyprus</ref>, but the main grant came from 
                     the <ref target="https://www.societyforlibyanstudies.org/">Society for Libyan Studies</ref>.</p>
                 <p>In 2016 Dr Gabriel Bodard (<ref target="https://ics.sas.ac.uk/">Institute of Classical Studies</ref>), received a grant from the <ref target="https://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</ref> to 
                     develop <ref target="https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES">EFES</ref>, a new publication platform for texts prepared in EpiDoc. In 2018 Roueché received a grant from the Society for Libyan Studies to 
                 set up the Inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica corpus in EFES,  and a further grant from the Society has enabled the publication of that corpus: 
                     <ref target="https://ircyr2020.inslib.kcl.ac.uk/en/">https://ircyr2020.inslib.kcl.ac.uk/</ref>.  
                     In 2021 the Society funded the development of IRT 2021, ther presetn publication.</p>
